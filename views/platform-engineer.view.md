5. **Emphasize**: System scale, reliability metrics, automation achievements

## Section Configuration

### Professional Summary
Use "Technical Leadership Summary" variant from profile/summary.md
- Emphasize infrastructure expertise and scale
- Highlight automation and developer productivity impact
- Include specific technologies and cloud platforms

### Professional Experience
- **Maximum Roles**: 4-5 roles
- **Detail Level**: Current role gets 5-6 bullets, others get 3-4 bullets
- **Focus Areas**: Infrastructure design, automation, monitoring, scalability
- **Metrics Emphasis**: Uptime, performance improvements, cost savings, developer productivity

### Key Projects Section
- Include 2-3 most relevant infrastructure/platform projects
- Prioritize migration, scaling, or automation projects
- Emphasize technical complexity and business impact

### Technical Skills
Group skills by category:
1. **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, GCP, Azure services

### Certifications
- Emphasize cloud certifications (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Include Kubernetes, security, or other infrastructure-related certs
- Show current status and renewal dates

## Length and Emphasis Guidelines

### Page Allocation (2 pages total)
- **Page 1**: Contact, Summary, Current Role, 1-2 Previous Roles
- **Page 2**: Additional Experience, Key Projects, Skills, Education, Certifications

### Bullet Point Allocation
- **Current Role**: 5-6 bullets (emphasize recent achievements)
- **Previous Roles**: 3-4 bullets each (focus on most relevant)
- **Projects**: 2-3 bullets each (technical approach and impact)

### Emphasis Areas
- **System Scale**: Always include user/transaction/data volumes
- **Reliability**: Uptime percentages, incident reduction, MTTR improvements

- **Cost Optimization**: Dollar amounts saved, efficiency gains
- **Developer Experience**: Deployment time reduction, automation impact

## Language and Tone Adjustments

### Technical Depth
- Use specific technology names and versions
- Include architectural patterns and design principles
- Mention compliance and security frameworks when relevant

### Industry Terminology
- "Infrastructure as Code" not "automated provisioning"
- "Observability" not just "monitoring"
- "Developer Experience" or "DevEx" for productivity improvements
- "Site Reliability" and "SLO/SLA" terminology

### Quantification Focus
- Uptime percentages (99.9%, 99.99%)
- Performance metrics (latency, throughput)
- Scale metrics (requests/second, data processed)
- Efficiency metrics (deployment frequency, lead time)
- Cost metrics (infrastructure spend, savings achieved)
