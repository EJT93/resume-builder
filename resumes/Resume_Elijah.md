Cloud Platform Engineer with a strong track record of designing, automating, and scaling enterprise infrastructure across AWS environments. I specialize in simplifying complex systems — from secure image pipelines and multi-account Terraform deployments to cross-region disaster recovery and containerized microservices. My background spans cloud engineering, Linux administration, and systems-level design, giving me a unique blend of hands-on technical depth and big-picture architectural thinking.

**Experience**  
**Platform Engineer			**						          	February 2024 Present  
*Maximus Inc*								           			Remote, USA	

* **Secure Image Management** – Engineered a Golden AMI pipeline leveraging Jenkins, EC2 Image Builder, and Groovy shared libraries; automated monthly hardened image creation and compliance validation, improving security posture and removing all manual effort.  
* **Infrastructure as Code & Pipeline Automation** – Delivered multi-environment Terraform configurations and Jenkins pipelines to provision ETL workloads on EC2, integrating Ansible and S3 for post-deployment setup. Reduced hours-long manual processes to single-click deployments.  
* **Cloud-Native Microservices** – Developed and maintained containerized Go microservices to automate complex AWS Aurora/MySQL operations across multiple tenants and environments, improving consistency and reducing manual intervention.  
* Deployed foundational platform infrastructure using Terraform (VPC, IAM, ACM certificates, Route 53, KMS keys, S3, and EKS clusters); delivered scalable, repeatable deployments that improved reliability and reduced deployment errors by 95%.  
* **Cross-Team Collaboration** – Led cross-team collaboration to design and implement a cross-account, cross-region data migration strategy, reducing migration timelines from 3+ weeks to under 24 hours and achieving 30% cost savings on data transfer.  
* **Cost Optimization** – Built an event-driven ETL process to archive and retrieve S3 objects; optimized data lifecycle policies and achieved 90% savings on Glacier storage costs.  
* **Disaster Recovery** – Implemented enterprise-grade disaster recovery (DR) solutions by automating cross-region EFS replication and failover/failback with Jenkins; provisioned AWS Transfer Family SFTP servers and synchronized Secrets Manager entries, ensuring near-zero downtime and compliance with business continuity standards.
