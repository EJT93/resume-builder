# Microservices Migration Project

## Context
TODO: Describe the business problem or opportunity that drove this migration. Include details about the existing monolithic system, its limitations, and the business case for microservices.

## Solution
TODO: High-level description of the migration approach and your specific contributions. Include:
- Migration strategy (strangler fig, big bang, etc.)
- Service decomposition approach
- Data migration strategy
- Your specific role and responsibilities

## Technical Implementation
- **Service Architecture**: TODO: Number of services, communication patterns
- **Data Strategy**: TODO: Database per service, shared databases, data consistency approach
- **Infrastructure**: TODO: Container orchestration, service discovery, load balancing
- **Monitoring**: TODO: Distributed tracing, logging, metrics collection
- **Security**: TODO: Service-to-service authentication, API security

## Challenges Overcome
- TODO: Major technical challenge and how it was resolved
- TODO: Organizational or process challenge and solution
- TODO: Performance or scalability issue addressed

## Impact
- **Performance**: TODO: Specific improvements in response time, throughput, etc.
- **Scalability**: TODO: Improved ability to handle load, scale individual services
- **Development Velocity**: TODO: Impact on team productivity, deployment frequency
- **Reliability**: TODO: Improvements in uptime, fault isolation, recovery time
- **Cost**: TODO: Infrastructure cost changes, operational efficiency gains

## Lessons Learned
TODO: Key insights from the project that would be valuable for future similar initiatives.
