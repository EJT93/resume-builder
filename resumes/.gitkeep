# Resumes Directory

This directory contains generated resume files.

Generated files are typically gitignored to avoid committing personal information,
but the directory structure is preserved with this .gitkeep file.

## File Naming Convention
- `{target-role}-{date}.md` for dated versions
- `{target-role}-latest.md` for current version  
- `{target-role}-{company}.md` for company-specific versions

## Generated File Structure
Each generated resume includes:
- Generation metadata (date, view used, atoms included)
- Assembled content from selected atoms
- Harvard resume format compliance
- ATS-friendly formatting for applicant tracking systems
