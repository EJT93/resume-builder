# Writing Rules and Standards

## Bullet Point Construction

### Structure Requirements
- Start with strong action verb in past tense (for completed roles) or present tense (for current role)
- Include specific context about what was done
- Quantify impact with metrics whenever possible
- Keep bullets to 1-2 lines maximum

### Action Verb Categories
**Leadership**: Led, Managed, Directed, Coordinated, Supervised, Mentored, Guided
**Creation**: Built, Developed, Designed, Created, Implemented, Established, Launched
**Improvement**: Optimized, Enhanced, Streamlined, Reduced, Increased, Improved, Accelerated
**Analysis**: Analyzed, Evaluated, Assessed, Investigated, Researched, Identified, Diagnosed
**Collaboration**: Collaborated, Partnered, Worked, Coordinated, Facilitated, Communicated

### Quantification Standards
Always include metrics when available:
- **Performance**: "Reduced API response time by 40% (from 200ms to 120ms)"
- **Scale**: "Managed infrastructure serving 10M+ daily active users"
- **Financial**: "Delivered $2M in annual cost savings through automation"
- **Team**: "Led cross-functional team of 8 engineers across 3 time zones"
- **Time**: "Completed project 3 weeks ahead of schedule"
- **Quality**: "Achieved 99.9% uptime SLA for critical services"

## ATS-Friendly Markdown Constraints

### Formatting Rules
- Use standard Markdown headers (# ## ###) - no custom formatting
- Bullet points with hyphens (-) only, no asterisks or plus signs
- No tables, complex formatting, or special characters
- No images, links in body text, or embedded content
- Keep line length under 80 characters when possible

### Keyword Optimization
- Include industry-standard terminology and acronyms
- Use both spelled-out and abbreviated forms (e.g., "Application Programming Interface (API)")
- Match job posting language when creating targeted resumes
- Include relevant technical skills naturally in context

### Structure Standards
- Consistent heading hierarchy across all atoms
- Parallel structure in bullet points within each section
- Chronological ordering (most recent first) for roles and education
- Logical grouping of related skills and achievements

## Metric Quality Standards

### Acceptable Metrics
- Specific numbers with context: "Reduced deployment time from 2 hours to 15 minutes"
- Percentage improvements: "Increased test coverage by 35%"
- Scale indicators: "Processed 1M+ transactions daily"
- Time-based achievements: "Delivered feature 2 weeks ahead of deadline"

### Unacceptable Metrics
- Vague quantities: "significantly improved", "greatly reduced"
- Unverifiable claims: "best-in-class performance"
- Relative comparisons without context: "50% better than before"
- Metrics without business context: "wrote 10,000 lines of code"

### Missing Metrics Protocol
When specific metrics are unavailable:
- Use TODO markers: "Reduced processing time by TODO% through optimization"
- Provide context clues: "Substantially reduced customer wait times (TODO: get specific metrics)"
- Include qualitative impact: "Improved user experience based on positive feedback"

## Tone and Voice Guidelines

### Professional Standards
- Use active voice consistently
- Maintain confident but not boastful tone
- Focus on contributions and impact, not just responsibilities
- Avoid first person pronouns (I, me, my)

### Industry Adaptation
- Match terminology to target industry
- Adjust technical depth based on audience
- Use appropriate level of formality
- Include relevant compliance or regulatory language when applicable

## Content Accuracy Requirements

### Fact Verification
- All dates must be accurate and verifiable
- Company names must be exact (including capitalization)
- Job titles must match official records
- Achievements must be truthful and supportable

### TODO Marker Usage
Use TODO markers for:
- Missing specific metrics: "TODO: get exact percentage improvement"
- Uncertain dates: "TODO: verify start date"
- Incomplete information: "TODO: add team size details"
- Pending verification: "TODO: confirm award name and date"
